## Summary
One drawback of the design is that the user has to know the exact value they are going to enter for the filters. This includes knowing the capitalization of the value (ex. tx instead of TX). A future enhancement would be to have a drop down box for the user to select values from instead of free form text field.  Another future enhancement would be changing the date field to allow for someone to select a range of time instead of a specific date.
